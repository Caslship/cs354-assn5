ABOUT
-----
This project implements a somewhat functional raytracer; it is the final project for the CS 354 Fall 2015 Computer
Graphics course at the University of Texas at Austin. In a class of about 50 or more students, this implementation placed 
2nd in a rendering speed test.

GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
------------------------
Aside from the default GUI components, a couple of new things have been added:

-- "AA Sample Factor" slider: This determines the square root of the number of samples to take when supersampling.
-- "Cubemap Motion Blur Factor" slider: This determines the DoF.
-- "Multi-Threading Factor" slider: This determines the square root of the number of threads to use to handle raytracing.
-- "KD-Tree" checkbox: Turn on/off the usage of kd-trees to handle intersection tests.
-- "Cubemap" checkbox: Turn on/off the usage of the current cubemap when rendering.
-- "File->Load Cubemap" menu selection: Select and load multiple pictures to serve as a cubemap.

EXTRA CREDIT
------------
Please take note of the following when grading:

-- Texture mapping has been implemented.
-- Depth of field has been added to the cubemap filter.
-- The program makes use of multiple threads for rendering.

DISCLAIMER
----------
I do not condone cheating. This project is available online to serve as a reference for both potential employers and 
anyone else who is curious.
